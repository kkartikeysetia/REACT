************************** VIRTUAL DOM || FIBRE *********************
virtual dom ko update krna kai liye algo : FIBRE

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layot
gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rende
into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.
Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new upd
in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurren
primitives.

reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts
to be changed. (browser & react tree)
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of SsetStates
Eventually results in a re-render.
